<h1>Playing a Cooncert</h1>
<p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time.</p>
<p>So we've put together a list of our top tips for great concerts.</p>
<h2>Copy out a set-list</h2>
<p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your songs in the order you'll play them.</p>
<p>Make copies for everyone.</p>
<p>Print it <strong>BIG!</strong> so that you can still read it if it's down by your feet on the floor or if the lighting isn't very good.</p>
<h2>Remember your spares</h2>
<p>Some instruments have parts that need to be relaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>guitar strings</li>
	<li>saxophone or clarinet reeds</li>
	<li>drumsticks</li>
</ul>
<p>Make a list of the spares you might need and make sure you know where they are in an emegency.</p>
<h2>Plan where you'll be on the stage</h2>
<p>Before you start to set up your instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Will the drums be centre stage? Or off to one sidde?</li>
	<li>Is there a power-socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands on the right?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's much better to think about all this <strong>before</strong> you start setting uup your instruuments. It's really annoying if you have to start unplugging things and swapping laces once youu've begun to set things up!</p>
<h2>Know where you're going, know when you're on</h2>
<p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Print out a map or set the sat nav before you set out. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unramiliar place half-an-hour beofore you're due to go on-stage.</p>
<p>And when you do arrive. the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on</strong>. On the night times often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Don't get caught out!</p>
